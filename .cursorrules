This is a solo-dev roguelite fungal base builder called "Mycelium Empire" made in Godot 4.

Key Gameplay Mechanics:
- World Generation: Procedurally generated caves using cellular automata. The cave walls are not uniform; they contain finite "Nutrient Veins".
- Dynamic Terrain: Minions harvest these veins, which destroys the wall tile and carves a new path. This makes resource gathering a strategic act of excavation and defense planning.
- Minion AI: Minions are autonomous and driven by a needs-based FSM. The player guides them by controlling the spread of the mycelium network.
- Escalating Events: A "Threat Meter" slowly fills during a run, triggering increasingly dangerous and varied events. Events are a mix of Threats (enemies, disasters), Opportunities (resource booms, artifacts), and Wrinkles (minor map changes), ensuring constant player engagement.
- Core Loop: A 30-60 minute roguelite run focused on expansion, harvesting, mutation, and survival, with meta-progression between runs.
